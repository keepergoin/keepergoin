### About me 
I'm some dude based in Milan, Italy currently finishing highschool. I started coding thanks to a friend of mine who showed me the way and immediatly fell in love with coding . At the moment I'm working on some projects of mine, trying to help out some friends and also learning from them. I love working with React, Astro, Svelte, Flutter and I'm planning to work with Swift too. I consider myself a hard worker and a patient fellar, i used to play videogames but I gave it up to focus only on coding. I love calisthenics and going to the gym.I aim to develop into a better person.
