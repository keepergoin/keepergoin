### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

### About me 
I'm some dude based in Milan, Italy. I started coding thanks to a friend of mine who showed me the way and immediatly fell in love with it. At the moment I'm working on some projects of mine, trying to help out some friends and also learning from them. I love working with React, Astro, Svelte, Flutter mostly front-end stuff but I'm currently learning Angular and Nest for work. I consider myself a hard worker and a patient fellar, i used to play videogames but I gave it up to focus only on coding. I love calisthenics and going to the gym. I aim to develop into a better person.
